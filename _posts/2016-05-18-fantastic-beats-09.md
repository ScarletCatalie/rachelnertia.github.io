Did anyone else play *War of the Ring* by Liquid Entertainment? Well, it was... okay. Sort of. At least it had a great soundtrack. [Have a listen](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7D9358DCD4B763AD).

Enjoy this [music which everyone is required to have a vocal opinion about, for some reason, even if it's not your thing and you're uninformed, seriously, what's up with that, chill the heck out people, it's okay to just not tell everyone what you think, the world will keep spinning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI2oS2hoL0k).

Let me know what you've been listening to lately!
