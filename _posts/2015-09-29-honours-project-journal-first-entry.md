title: Honours Project Journal - First Entry
---

Over the summer I thought a lot about what I could do for my Honours project and dissertation, but didn't have the time and space to really home in on a specific thing and start working because of work commitments and big (really big) personal issues. The weeks since the start of term have been pretty hectic and I've been putting off starting this journal until now because of other responsibilities and not being quite certain what I want to write making it difficult to find the energy and the inclination to put fingers to keys. I'm ready now, my head is in some kind of ordered state, so here we go.

There's a few criteria I bear in mind when thinking about Honours project ideas. One is how 'squishy' the subject is - I'd rather work on something focused and clear than on something broad and vague. Another is how well I can imagine a final product - will I come out the end with a good 'demo' for the graduate showcase and beyond? Yet another is whether I feel like I'm exploring something new, that my project is unique and stands out. Finally, the kicker is whether I think I can conjure up a good research question and therefore a dissertation. 

Things I've thought about doing include real-time interactive procedural walking, artificial intelligence, things to do with using raycasting to render 3D worlds, things to do with using voxels to represent 3D worlds, and a whole plethora of things about generally representing volumes and rendering them. I'll try to cover my various ideas as a series of short journal entries, rather than making this one big and messy.
