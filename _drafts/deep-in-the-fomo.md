* Things I have FOMO for
* Things I don't have FOMO for
* Big things (such as honours project) being supplanted by many smaller things
* Conclusion...?


I have real bad Fear Of Missing Out, and you probably do too. It's natural. Is it a motivating force or a de-motivating force? Is it constructive or destructive? Let's talk about it.

It means different things in different contexts, right? Like, there's a different collection of feelings comprising FOMO when you're weighing up whether or not to buy a particular game than when you're trying to figure out where you want to live and work for the next two years.
