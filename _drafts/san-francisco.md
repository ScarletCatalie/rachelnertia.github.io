I was recently in San Francisco for 5-ish days to attend [Game Developer's Conference]({% post_url 2017-03-14-my-first-gdc %}). It was my first time in an American city -- previous trips to the US have taken me to skiing resorts, and nowhere else. We spent most of our time in and around the conference, and only really had time for a bit of proper sightseeing on Saturday.

It's a nice place, but very different to what I'm used to. In Scotland we barely have any tall buildings, so when I was surrounded on all sides by skyscrapers I felt a little bit like I was going to fall into the sky, which is the most country-bumpkin thing about myself I've ever admitted (on this blog).

We visited Pier 39 in Fisherman's Wharf, the touristy waterfront district, where they have lots of shops selling seafood and souvenir stuff, and sealions.

It's also one of the places where you can get a boat out to Alcatraz, the famous prison island, or to explore the Bay.

You can see the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. It's called that because it bridges the Golden Gate, which is the narrow strait connecting the Bay to the Pacific Ocean.

On one of the piers at Fisherman's Wharf is the [Musée Mécanique](http://www.museemecaniquesf.com/), a museum for old arcade machines, from titles as recent as Tekken to contraptions that date back to as early as the 1930s, honky-tonk self-playing pianos, zoetropes with handles the viewer must crank, archaic shooting galleries. It's free to enter, but you have to pay about a quarter for each machine, just like a real arcade. What I was most struck by was getting to play an original version of *Asteroids* and discovering just how much I underestimated the brightness of the vector display. The bullets fired by the player and the UFO are as bright as phosphorus flares against the deep blackness of the screen.
