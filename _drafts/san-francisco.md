I was recently in San Francisco for 5-ish days to attend Game Developer's Conference. It was my first time in an American city -- previous trips to the US have taken me to skiing resorts, and nowhere else. We spent most of our time in and around the conference, and only really had time for a bit of proper sightseeing on Saturday.

It's a nice place, but very different to what I'm used to. In Scotland we barely have any tall buildings, so when I was surrounded on all sides by skyscrapers I felt a little bit like I was going to fall into the sky, which is the most country-bumpkin thing I've ever admitted about myself (on this blog).

We visited Pier 39 in Fisherman's Wharf, the touristy waterfront district, where they have lots of shops selling seafood and souvenir stuff, and sealions.

It's also one of the places where you can get a boat out to Alcatraz, the famous prison island, or to explore the Bay.

You can see the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. It's called that because it bridges the Golden Gate, which is the narrow strait through which all the water in the Bay gets in and out.
