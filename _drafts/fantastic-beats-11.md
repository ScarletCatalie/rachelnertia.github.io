65daysofstatic, No Man's Sky

I wouldn't doubt you if you said all post rock sounded the same to you. It kind of does. So if you're a post rock band, I'm sorry - unless you're Godspeed You! Black Emperor, or doing something unusual, I probably find you more or less indistinguishable musically and aesthetically from pretty much every other post rock band. The matter of which post rock bands individual people are into most seems to be more of a matter of just which one they happened upon first, their introduction to the genre. For me I guess that was Explosions in the Sky, or maybe, uh, Maybeshewill. Not 65daysofstatic. (These names are stupid.) So I hadn't really bought or listened much to 65days' stuff until this, the soundtrack for *No Man's Sky*:

Which is, yeah, damn good.

Games do well when they use post rock in their soundtracks. Have you played *Spec Ops: The Line*? It has a [great post rock soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb7Uu6Bz_wM), and really good use of [Mogwai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6y_KScT2vs) (can you *misuse* Mogwai?) at one point. I guess *The Last of Us*'s soundtrack is kinda post rock, or post rock influenced, at least: try the [main theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwDkutphzmU) and see if you agree.
