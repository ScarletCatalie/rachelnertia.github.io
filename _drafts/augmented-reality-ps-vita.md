The coursework for Applied Game Technologies[^1] lets you do more or less what you want, within constraints. What you make has to 1) be a game, 2) use either a) red-blue anaglyph [stereoscopic 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy) on PC or b) augmented reality on the PS Vita. I chose the latter option.

Unfortunately there's no way to capture video straight from the PS Vita's screen without a bunch of hackery, so I had to get my friend David Ferguson to film over my shoulder while I played. Thanks, David!

I'm fairly pleased with how it all turned out. Around week 7 Grant prompted us to take a couple hours just to do a bit of research, come up with an idea and a plan for how to execute the idea. And I did, surprisingly efficiently. I had a bunch of ideas, so I picked the one that seemed to best occupy the ground between 'easy' and 'interesting'. Then I wrote down all the things I could think of that I'd need to do: things to figure out, assets to make, code to write. Wherever I could, I cut ideas or relegated them to a box of 'extra features' so that the scope of the project was as contained as possible. Then I divided all the tasks over the 6 weeks or so that I had, giving myself a bite-size chunk of work to do each week. It never felt like I was spending too much time on it, but I had everything completed, including the written report, well before the deadline.

I think my main take-away is that a good plan well-executed really teaches you the value of creating a good plan and sticking to it. It seems like an obvious lesson, but as someone whose plans tend to devolve and quite often end up being ignored, I never really appreciated it. Having had quite limited time to work on things recently because of crappy mental health has made it imperative to make the most out of that time, so I'm glad I'm learning how and managing to do things I'm happy with despite the circumstances.

[^1]: No, it's not a very good name for a module. Especially for one on a course named 'Computer Games Technology.'
