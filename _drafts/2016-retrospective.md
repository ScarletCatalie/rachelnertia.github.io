You have to take the good with the bad. You have to take a step back and enumerate the things that made you happy in the year and avoid fixating on the awful stuff. Only the light can keep out the dark, after all.

That opening would have been more appropriate for my 2015 retrospective, had I written one. Yes, the worst event in my life so far occurred in mid-2015. Yes, it overshadowed everything and almost destroyed me. But the scale of a loss is proportional to the value of what was lost, and the good times I got to have with Danielle before she died were unforgettable. And other good things happened in 2015, too, some of them related to the grief I shared with others and that bound us together closer than before, and some of them completely tangential. 2015 was the worst year, but also one in which I was amazed by love.

That's enough about 2015. I just thought it would be useful to provide some context.

2016, huh?

### I finished university somehow

### I got a job somehow

### Lots of good games

### Good pals
