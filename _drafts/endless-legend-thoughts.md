*I am many things,* begins the voiceover of *Endless Legend*'s intro movie.

Do I like this game?

I cannot tell. There are so many things to like.

*Do I like this game?*

I like that the minor faction system helps tie the evolution of your civilization to geography.

There's so much information that's simply *missing* from the interface. I can find out my diplomatic status with each of the other players at a quick glance, but their relations to one another are hidden from view. When you decide to negotiate with another computer, the screen you're taken to is inscrutable.

Management of the research queue is a chore, with no option to reshuffle the position of technologies within it. Instead, changing the order means removing everything from the queue and then re-queuing them up. I've ended up not using the research queue at all.

You have a 'main quest' through which you can eventually win the game.

It's disappointing that when you take a rival's city, it is immediately re-skinned from their faction's style to your own. This is disappointing. It's like, thematically, city capturing isn't meant to happen.
