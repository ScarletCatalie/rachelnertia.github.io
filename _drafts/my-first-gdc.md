Game Developers Conference is an annual gathering of people involved in the game industry from all over the world. It takes place in and around the Moscone Centre in San Francisco, California. I've always wanted to go, but it's expensive to get out there and get accommodation and *very* expensive for the kind of pass that gets you into lots of interesting talks and events, which is one of the main reasons to go. The IGDA (International Game Developers Association), among other organisations and companies, usually offer scholarships to help get people out there, but I've never been lucky or cool enough to be awarded one.

This year, I was so lucky I got to attend anyway.

### *Hook, Line and Thinker*

This is [a game](https://rhythmlynx.itch.io/hook-line-and-thinker) by my friend [Connor](https://twitter.com/rhythm_lynx) that he originally made for [Fishing Jam](https://itch.io/jam/fishing-jam-2) on [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a fantasy console. He began working on a post-jam version with [Andrew](https://twitter.com/Doddsy91) helping on the audio side of things.

### Defold

A [game engine](http://www.defold.com/) developed by [King](https://king.com/) with a focus on 2D, mobile games. I haven't had a chance to really play around with it yet. They held a competition to encourage people to make games with it, offering as a reward to winners of the competition paid-for flights for up to three people to San Francisco, with GDC expo tickets and hotel rooms to boot, and a dedicated booth space for showing off the game they submitted. Connor and Andrew ported *Hook, Line and Thinker* to Defold and entered the competition. They won. They invited me to come as their third 'team member' in early January, just as I was resigned to not getting to go to GDC this year.

I was quite surprised!

### Talks

There was a possibility (which I didn't investigate) of being able to upgrade my expo pass to one that would let me attend talks if I negotiated with the right people at my company about it. I was right not to waste time doing so, though -- we weren't there for the first two days of the conference, which is when most of the extremely juicy talks are, and between manning the booth, exploring the expo and meeting people there was barely any time to go to talks anyway.

I did get to go to two talks. On Thursday morning I attended Ste Curran's talk on gun violence in games (some of his previous GDC talks are available on the web, and are excellent), and on Friday I attended a brief talk on prototyping (it was okay).

### Expo

The Moscone Centre consists of three enormous buildings called the North, South and West halls. The West hall was mostly dedicated to talks, containing some pretty cavernous lecture rooms, but had two relaxed areas for videogames (the Indie Megabooth and Mild Rumpus) and a corner for board games run by [Shut Up and Sit Down](). The South hall was the bigger of the two expo halls, full of big players like Microsoft, Oculus/Facebook and Sony, as well as booths dedicated to national representation like the Scottish booth. The North hall contained all the wee games, the Independent Games Festival finalists, the universities and colleges, and is where we were situated.  

The 'Made with Defold' booth was in the corner of the hall, but the expo was so busy there was a lot of traffic coming our way anyway. The other games at the booth were cool and the developers of each were all cool, nice people. Almost everyone who played *Hook, Line and Thinker* enjoyed it, and some played almost every level. Those who had things they didn't like about it always offered constructive feedback.

During the times I got to explore the hall I managed to see a number of interesting games, and play a few. It was pretty cool to get to interact with the developers of the IGF award-nominated games at the IGF pavilion, many of whom I look up to and admire for their work.

### People


....

I just attended my first ever Game Developers Conference (GDC), which is an annual get-together in San Francisco where people in the games industry from all over the world pile into the Moscone Centre, and the surrounding area, in order to show off their games, hawk their wares, have meetings, network and party an awful lot. We have a bit of time left to kill in San Francisco before our flight back to the UK, so I'm seizing the opportunity to write about my experience.

I actually only got to come to GDC because of luck. I happen to be friends with Connor Halford and Andrew Dodds, who won a competition run by King to make a game with their engine, Defold. Connor and Andrew ported their fishing jam game, originally made on Pico-8, to Defold, and were chosen as one of 6 teams to be flown out and put up in a hotel and attend the GDC expo as exhibitors to demonstrate what was possible with the engine which is still largely unheard of. Each team was given three 'golden tickets', and so Connor and Andrew invited me to join them in San Francisco. Very, very lucky.

Travelling there went well. I had to stay in a hotel near Glasgow airport for Monday night because my flight to Heathrow was very early on Tuesday morning. It was okay! I met Andrew at Glasgow airport and we flew down to Heathrow. Our flight from there to SF was surprisingly pleasant -- it was practically empty, so a lot of people (including myself) got a whole 3 seats to themselves. I'm hoping that the return flight is equally pleasant, but I know that comfortable long-haul flights are a rarity.

Arriving in San Francisco at around 2pm we took the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit -- the urban rail network for the area) with Connor straight from departures to the financial district, checked into our hotel, and wandered in search of things to look at and a place to get dinner. After dinner we went to a playtesting event. This was in a meeting room in a hotel I can't remember the name of - the place was massive and had entire floors dedicated to conferences. Me and Andrew had been up and on the move for around 26 hours at this point, so we were flagging pretty badly, and made our way back to our hotel to get some rest.

I found I wasn't affected by jetlag at all. I woke up between 5:30 and 6am every morning, which is more or less when I normally wake up at home.

On Wednesday we hit the Moscone Centre. The place is massive, comprising of 3 buildings - North, South and West. North and South are two massive underground expo halls, connected by a tunnel that goes beneath the road that separates them on the surface. West is a multi-storey building about the size of Dundee in which most of the talks were held.

The 'Made With Defold' booth was situated in the corner of North. It seemed like *Hook, Line and Thinker* went down really well with almost everyone who gave it a try, and it was fun to
