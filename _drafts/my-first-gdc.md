[Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/) is an annual gathering of people involved in the game industry from all over the world. It takes place in and around the [Moscone Centre](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Moscone+Center/@37.7838675,-122.4034264,17z) in San Francisco, California. I've always wanted to go, but it's expensive to get out there and get accommodation and *very* expensive for the kind of pass that gets you into lots of interesting talks and events, which is one of the main reasons to go. The [IGDA (International Game Developers Association)](http://scholars.igdafoundation.org/) offer scholarships to help get people out there, but I've never been lucky enough to get one.

However, by good fortune I got to go anyway. I was in San Francisco from Tuesday 28th February until Sunday 5th March and have spent most of my free time since I got back recovering. Here are some words about my trip.

### *Hook, Line and Thinker*

This is [a game](https://rhythmlynx.itch.io/hook-line-and-thinker) by my friend [Connor](https://twitter.com/rhythm_lynx) that he originally made for [Fishing Jam](https://itch.io/jam/fishing-jam-2) on [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a fantasy console. He began working on a post-jam version with [Andrew](https://twitter.com/Doddsy91) helping on the audio side of things.

### Defold

A [game engine](http://www.defold.com/) developed by [King](https://king.com/) with a focus on 2D, mobile games. I haven't had a chance to really play around with it yet. They held a competition to encourage people to make games with it, offering as a reward to winners of the competition paid-for flights for up to three people to San Francisco, with GDC expo tickets and hotel rooms to boot, and a dedicated booth space for showing off the game they submitted. Connor and Andrew ported *Hook, Line and Thinker* to Defold and entered the competition. They won. They invited me to come as their third 'team member' in early January, just as I was resigned to not getting to go to GDC this year.

I was quite surprised!

### Talks

// TODO: Image

There was a possibility (which I didn't investigate) of being able to upgrade my expo pass to one that would let me attend talks if I negotiated with the right people at my company about it. I was right not to waste time doing so, though -- we weren't there for the first two days of the conference, which is when most of the extremely juicy talks are, and between manning the booth, exploring the expo and meeting people there was barely any time to go to talks anyway.

I got to attend two talks. On Thursday morning I attended Ste Curran's talk [on gun violence in games](http://stecurran.com/double-tap/) (some of his previous GDC talks are available on the web, and are [excellent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W1sHzgAnVs&ab_channel=Anilusion)), and on Friday I attended a brief talk on prototyping (it was okay).

### Expo

// TODO: Image

The Moscone Centre consists of three enormous buildings called the North, South and West halls. The West hall was mostly dedicated to talks, containing some pretty cavernous lecture rooms, but had two relaxed areas for videogames (the [Indie Megabooth](http://indiemegabooth.com/announcing-line-gdc-2017/) and [Mild Rumpus](http://thewildrumpus.co.uk/mildrumpus)) and a corner for board games run by [Shut Up and Sit Down](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/). The South hall was the bigger of the two expo halls, full of big players like Microsoft, Oculus/Facebook and Sony, as well as booths dedicated to national representation like the Scottish booth. The North hall contained all the wee games, the [Independent Games Festival](http://www.igf.com/) finalists, the universities and colleges, and is where we were situated.  

The 'Made with Defold' booth was in the corner of the hall, but the expo was so busy there was a lot of traffic coming our way anyway. The other games at the booth were cool and the developers of each were all cool, nice people. Almost everyone who played *Hook, Line and Thinker* enjoyed it, and some played almost every level. Those who had things they didn't like about it always offered constructive feedback.

During the times I got to explore the hall I managed to see a number of interesting games, and play a few. It was pretty cool to get to interact with the developers of the IGF award-nominated games at the IGF pavilion, many of whom I look up to and admire for their work. Mostly I just embarrassed myself when I tried to speak to 'famous' devs; I imagine it must be pretty exhausting to have people constantly coming up to you and squee-ing about how excited they are to meet you all day. There was also a collection of interesting things in the [Alt.Ctrl.GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/news/heres-lineup-games-playable-gdc-2017s-alt-ctrl-gdc-showcase/) section.

On Wednesday evening me and Connor went to watch the IGF and Game Developer's Choice awards, a glitzy event where a handful of critically successful games are held up above the rest. I have mixed feelings about awards, award ceremonies and the effects they have, but both the back-to-back shows were highly entertaining. Nina Freeman and Tim Schafer hosted the IGF and Game Developer's Choice awards respectively; both were good but Schafer's ability to crack jokes and hold attention is incredible -- they're available to watch [online](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/125754127). It was neat to attend in person because there's a vibe in the room that just doesn't come across when you're watching it over a livestream.

### People

There was a good crowd of people I know from the Scottish game dev community wandering about, some who I hadn't spoken to in a while, and it was good to catch up. More importantly I got to meet a lot of new people. On Friday evening I went to the Shut Up and Sit Down after party, learned a new game (*Good Cop Bad Cop* -- an excellent wee hidden roles game) and got to hug Paul Dean.

All in all, a very successful trip. I hope I get to go again!
