title: My First Time in San Francisco and First GDC
layout: post
---

I just attended my first ever Game Developers Conference (GDC), which is an annual get-together in San Francisco where people in the games industry from all over the world pile into the Moscone Centre, and the surrounding area, in order to show off their games, hawk their wares, have meetings, network and party an awful lot. We have a bit of time left to kill in San Francisco before our flight back to the UK, so I'm seizing the opportunity to write about my experience.

I actually only got to come to GDC because of luck. I happen to be friends with Connor Halford
