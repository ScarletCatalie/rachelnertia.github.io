title: My First Time in San Francisco and First GDC

I just attended my first ever Game Developers Conference (GDC), which is an annual get-together in San Francisco where people in the games industry from all over the world pile into the Moscone Centre, and the surrounding area, in order to show off their games, hawk their wares, have meetings, network and party an awful lot. We have a bit of time left to kill in San Francisco before our flight back to the UK, so I'm seizing the opportunity to write about my experience.

I actually only got to come to GDC because of luck. I happen to be friends with Connor Halford and Andrew Dodds, who won a competition run by King to make a game with their engine, Defold. Connor and Andrew ported their fishing jam game, originally made on Pico-8, to Defold, and were chosen as one of 6 teams to be flown out and put up in a hotel and attend the GDC expo as exhibitors to demonstrate what was possible with the engine which is still largely unheard of. Each team was given three 'golden tickets', and so Connor and Andrew invited me to join them in San Francisco. Very, very lucky.

Travelling there went well. I had to stay in a hotel near Glasgow airport for Monday night because my flight to Heathrow was very early on Tuesday morning. It was okay! I met Andrew at Glasgow airport and we flew down to Heathrow. Our flight from there to SF was surprisingly pleasant -- it was practically empty, so a lot of people (including myself) got a whole 3 seats to themselves. I'm hoping that the return flight is equally pleasant, but I know that comfortable long-haul flights are a rarity.

Arriving in San Francisco at around 2pm we took the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit -- the urban rail network for the area) with Connor straight from departures to the financial district, checked into our hotel, and wandered in search of things to look at and a place to get dinner. After dinner we went to a playtesting event. This was in a meeting room in a hotel I can't remember the name of - the place was massive and had entire floors dedicated to conferences. Me and Andrew had been up and on the move for around 26 hours at this point, so we were flagging pretty badly, and made our way back to our hotel to get some rest.

I found I wasn't affected by jetlag at all. I woke up between 5:30 and 6am every morning, which is more or less when I normally wake up at home. 

On Wednesday we hit the Moscone Centre. The place is massive, comprising of 3 buildings - North, South and West. North and South are two massive underground expo halls, connected by a tunnel that goes beneath the road that separates them on the surface. West is a multi-storey building about the size of Dundee in which most of the talks were held.
