## Inchcolm Project, Sunday 16th October

I had some good new experiences last week. On Sunday the 16th of October I was one of seventy-ish people to take a ferry out to the small isle of [Inchcolm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchcolm), on the northern side of the Firth of Forth, in order to take part in an experience best described simply as '*Dear Esther* in real life'.

With our smartphones in our hands, we roamed the island's pathways, navigating our way towards the specific geo-tagged areas in which we'd receive a little audio narration from a sad man. Not the same sad man as the one from *Dear Esther* -- this one was bereaved by the loss of a Rachel, and had a Scottish accent rather than an English one. Hearing this guy open his speeches with my name over and over again, I couldn't help but feel it leant a little something to my experience that made it a bit different from that of non-Rachels on the island. It was hard to take and digest in all the narrative that was there in the time we had, but there was definitely an appreciable level of terror of the sea, which I can relate to. There were symbolic installations scattered around the island (some in quite hard to find places), and members of [The Mantra Collective](https://twitter.com/mantra_sound) gave musical accompaniments to some spaces. You could walk through the pitch-black tunnel that runs through one of the island's two hills to the sound of a violin, its notes echoing eerily through the darkness. Emerging into the sunlight at the other end was pretty spectacular.

Inchcolm is a beautiful place. It's not surprising it's a popular wedding venue. The ruined abbey is kept company by the bunkers and turrets built to defend the Firth in various wars -- almost all the islands in the Firth are encrusted with these crumbling concrete barnacles. There are seals in the waters around Inchcolm who swim into the little bay where a thin strip of grassy green land connects the two halves of the island. I think they know people love to spot them and come close just to bask in their attention. There is a rock out a bit into the water which has been covered in garden gnomes and christened, yes, 'Inch-gnome'.

While we were there the weather cleared up a little bit, and surprisingly warm rays of sunshine made their way towards us from the West, shining down on the two (almost three) Forth bridges in the distance. To the south there was a clear view to Edinburgh, dominated by Arthur's Seat, looking small and windswept, but proud nonetheless.

At the end of our time on the island we went into a darkened room in the abbey to watch *Dear Esther* being played from the caves up to the end, projected onto the rough stone wall. Then, led into another room by The Mantra Collective's singer, were played several songs from the game by the whole ensemble. It's beautiful music, and I'm grateful to have been able to experience it in such a stunning environment.

There's an [article](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/discover/news/news-archive/2016/name,31749,en.html) about the project on the Abertay University website, written before the fact. Hopefully some photos will go online somewhere at some point!

## Games Are For Everyone, Thursday 20th October

I hadn't been to one of these before. I decided to volunteer to help out.
