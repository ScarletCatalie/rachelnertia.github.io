I had two new experiences last week that were eye-opening and inspiring: a journey to an island, and a journey underground...

## Inchcolm Project, Sunday 16th October

I was one of seventy-ish lucky people to take a ferry from South Queensferry out to the small isle of [Inchcolm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchcolm) in order to take part in an experience best described simply as '*Dear Esther* in real life'.

With our smartphones in our hands, we roamed the island's pathways, navigating our way towards the specific geo-tagged areas in which we'd receive a little audio narration from a sad man. Not the same sad man as the one from *Dear Esther* -- this one was bereaved by the loss of a Rachel, and had a Scottish accent rather than an English one. Hearing this guy open his speeches with my name over and over again, I couldn't help but feel it leant a little something to my experience that made it a bit different to that of non-Rachels on the island. It was hard to take in and digest all the narrative that was there in the time we had, but there was definitely an appreciable level of terror of the sea, which I can relate to. There were symbolic, story-related art installations scattered around the island (some in quite hard to find places), and members of the [Mantra Collective](https://twitter.com/mantra_sound) playing musical accompaniments to some spaces. You could walk through the pitch-black tunnel that runs through one of the island's two hills to the sound of a violin, its notes echoing eerily through the darkness, and emerge blinking into the sunlight at the other end, feeling very spectacular indeed.

Inchcolm is a beautiful place. Its ruined abbey is kept company by the bunkers and turrets of various wars -- almost all the islands in the Firth are encrusted with these crumbling concrete barnacles. There are seals in the surrounding waters who swim into the little bay where the boat docks and a thin strip of grassy green land connects the two halves of the island. I think they know people love to spot them and come close just to bask in attention. There is a rock out a bit into the water which has been covered in garden gnomes and christened, yes, 'Inch-gnome'.

While we were there the weather cleared up a little bit, and surprisingly warm rays of sunshine made their way towards us from the West, shining down on the two (almost three) Forth bridges in the distance. To the south there was a clear view to Edinburgh, looking small and windswept in the shadow of Arthur's Seat, but proud nonetheless.

At the end of our time on the island we went into a darkened room in the abbey to watch *Dear Esther* being played, projected onto the rough stone wall. Then, led into another room, we were played several songs from the game by the whole Mantra Collective. It's beautiful music, and I'm grateful to have been able to experience it in such a stunning environment.

There's an [article](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/discover/news/news-archive/2016/name,31749,en.html) about the project on the Abertay University website, written before the fact. Hopefully some photos will go online somewhere at some point!

## Games Are For Everyone, Thursday 20th October

Through a mixture of bad luck and incompetence on my part, this was the first Games Are For Everyone I've managed to attend, and oh boy do I feel sad about missing out on all the previous events.

The venue was The Caves, a massive cellar-turned-club in the bowels of the Edinburgh old town (it's just off Cowgate, to be exact). What a weird, cool space to be in! The whole place was open for the event, I think, with a loud central chamber full of music and noisy games and quieter antechambers off to the side, rooms of all different sizes and shapes that filled up with attendees fast. It was like a cool mini one-night expo.

There were a lot of games there. Some were running on television screens or monitors, while others were set up in these cool faux-arcade cabinets that We Throw Switches have. Among the lineup were:

<add links>

- *Lieve Oma*, by Florian Veltman <check>. I played this when it came out and it's one of my favourites of the year. I heartily recommend checking it out.
- *Manifold Garden*: There's a lot of hype around this extremely gif-able game. It certainly looks extremely cool, and every time I look at it I can't help but try to work out how it does its infinitely-repeating-world thing. Unfortunately I didn't play it while I had the chance.
- *Pathfinder*: You don't play this game. Instead, you watch a drummer play it. Using a drumkit. It's kind of amazing, even if half the time you can't work out what the hell is going on.
- *Gravity Pong*, by Cesar Parent <check sp>. This is a neat little twist on Pong, delivered with a lot of polish. There seemed to be people playing against their friends on it more or less non-stop.

And there were a tonne of others, all really cool.

*Devil Daggers* was there, to my pleasant surprise, so I got to show off my skills. I can only make it up to about 150 seconds, so they're not that impressive, but the observers for whom this was their first encounter with the game were incredulous. The game had a room all to itself -- a cellar to the side of the main one, a little smaller but with just as high-vaulted a ceiling -- in which red candles had been lit. The game was being projected onto the bare stones of the wall, just like Dear Esther had been, so everyone could get a good view of the action.

That's the really great thing about events like GAFE -- putting individual games on their own pedestals, valuing them, bringing people together around them, and introducing them to fresh eyes. Awesome stuff.

I got to meet lots of new people as well as chat with existing games friends, which is something I seem to thrive on, and I also got to help out a little with running the event, which was rewarding despite the fact I didn't really get to sit down for the whole evening.

All in all a good time, but I don't think dragging myself home at 1 in the morning on a workday is something I should repeat often.
