## Inchcolm Project, Sunday 16th October

I had some good new experiences last week. On Sunday the 16th of October I was one of seventy-ish people to take a ferry out to the small isle of [Inchcolm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchcolm), on the northern side of the Firth of Forth, in order to take part in an experience best described simply as '*Dear Esther* in real life'.

With our smartphones in our hands, we roamed the island's pathways, navigating our way towards the specific geo-tagged areas in which we'd receive a little audio narration from a sad man. Not the same sad man as the one from *Dear Esther* -- this one was bereaved by the loss of a Rachel, and had a Scottish accent rather than an English one. Hearing this guy open his speeches with my name over and over again, I couldn't help but feel it leant a little something to my experience that made it a bit different from that of non-Rachels on the island. It was hard to take and digest in all the narrative that was there in the time we had, but there was definitely an appreciable level of terror of the sea, which I can relate to. There were symbolic installations scattered around the island (some in quite hard to find places), and members of [The Mantra Collective](https://twitter.com/mantra_sound) gave musical accompaniments to some spaces. You could walk through the pitch-black tunnel that runs through one of the island's two hills to the sound of a violin, its notes echoing eerily through the darkness. Emerging into the sunlight at the other end was pretty spectacular.

Inchcolm is a beautiful place. It's not surprising it's a popular wedding venue. The ruined abbey is kept company by the bunkers and turrets built to defend the Firth in various wars -- almost all the islands in the Firth are encrusted with these crumbling concrete barnacles. There are seals in the waters around Inchcolm who swim into the little bay where a thin strip of grassy green land connects the two halves of the island. I think they know people love to spot them and come close just to bask in their attention. There is a rock out a bit into the water which has been covered in garden gnomes and christened, yes, 'Inch-gnome'.

While we were there the weather cleared up a little bit, and surprisingly warm rays of sunshine made their way towards us from the West, shining down on the two (almost three) Forth bridges in the distance. To the south there was a clear view to Edinburgh, dominated by Arthur's Seat, looking small and windswept, but proud nonetheless.

At the end of our time on the island we went into a darkened room in the abbey to watch *Dear Esther* being played from the caves up to the end, projected onto the rough stone wall. Then, led into another room by The Mantra Collective's singer, were played several songs from the game by the whole ensemble. It's beautiful music, and I'm grateful to have been able to experience it in such a stunning environment.

There's an [article](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/discover/news/news-archive/2016/name,31749,en.html) about the project on the Abertay University website, written before the fact. Hopefully some photos will go online somewhere at some point!

## Games Are For Everyone, Thursday 20th October

Through a mixture of bad luck and incompetence on my part, this was the first Games Are For Everyone I've managed to attend, and oh boy do I feel sad about missing out on all the previous events.

The venue was The Caves, a massive cellar-turned-club in the bowels of the Edinburgh old town (it's just off Cowgate, to be exact). What a weird, cool space to be in! The whole place was open for the event, I think, with a loud central chamber full of music and noisy games and quieter antechambers off to the side, rooms of all different sizes and shapes that filled up with attendees fast.

There were a lot of games there. Some were running on television screens or monitors, while others were set up in these cool faux-arcade cabinets that We Throw Switches have. Among the lineup was:

I got to show off my *Devil Daggers* skills. I can only make it up to about 150 seconds, so they're not that impressive, but the observers for whom this was their first encounter with the game were a incredulous. The game had a room all to itself -- a cellar to the side of the main one, a little smaller but with just as high-vaulted a ceiling -- in which red candles had been lit. The game was being projected onto the bare stones of the wall so everyone could get a good view of the action.

That's the really great thing about events like GAFE -- putting individual games on their own pedestals, valuing them, bringing people together around them, and introducing them to fresh eyes. Good stuff.

I got to meet lots of new people and chat with existing games friends, which is something I seem to thrive on. I also got to help out a little with running the event, which was really rewarding. Nonetheless, dragging myself home at 1 in the morning, on a workday, is not something to be repeated that often.
