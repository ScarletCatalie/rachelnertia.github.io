It sounds like a good time was had by all who attended [Steam Dev Days](http://steamcommunity.com/devdays) in October. For us shmucks who weren't able to go, Valve have kindly put recordings of the talks online. The full playlist is [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLckFgM6dUP2ihiMeKHoyIdHvhRSyqwQsp). I've watched most of all of them, and can guide you towards what I think are the best ones. Here are the videos I think are worth watching.

### Welcome

This is basically just a mission statement for what Steam Dev Days is aiming to be: not an expo, more of a conference.

### Steam Business Update

It's really cool to look back over the years and reflect on how Steam has evolved over the years. I've been there for almost all of that time, getting Steam when it came packaged with *Dark Messiah of Might and Magic* and gradually becoming more of a regular user until *The Orange Box* turned me into a lifelong Valve fan and enormous Steam library-haver. I can remember Steam's first, kind of crappy iteration, and the way it's changed all the way up to the terrifying juggernaut that it is today. It's interesting to get the perspective of someone at Valve on that history, and learn about where they think they're taking the platform next.

### Steam Controller

Input programming is usually pretty horrible in my experience, for all the reasons Lars Doucet (developer on *Defenders Quest*) talks about. His enthusiasm is infectious -- I wasn't interested in the Steam Controller before this talk, but now I want to get one just so that I can play with the library.

### Sound Advice from Successful Developers

Does what it says on the tin, and is good at it. Businessy.

### UGC and Workshop in *ARK: Survival Evolved*



### Early Access

This panel is great, with worthy discussion of the pros and cons of Early Access from developers working on the frontline. Each panellist has a different perspective and approach, but no one positions themselves as the developer who got it 'right'. There's a bit of ego-grooming, but it's not bad.

### Anti-Cheat for Multiplayer Games

I don't cheat in games. Consequently, I know nothing about how cheating is done, and therefore less than nothing about how to prevent it. I like the presenter's examples of simple game design changes that can discourage cheating. It's also useful to have an overview of Steam's anti-cheat and game moderation features.

### Healthy Publisher Relationships

Put together, the people on this panel have enough industry experience to make [metaphor goes here]. They have a lot of really well-articulated advice to share on when and when not to get a publisher, and how to do it properly.

### Vulkan Graphics

A panel of graphics programmers talk about Vulkan. They seem pretty pleased with it, and I'm now even more eager to learn it and try making something with it if I ever find a spare few days.

### VR Developer Panel

I don't have one of these newfangled 'VRs', but it's not hard to tell there's a lot of interesting stuff to talk about with regards to making VR games. In this panel the developers of *Fantastic Contraption*, *Hover Junkers*, *Space Pirate Trainer* and *Audioshield* share the insights they've gained from working on the frontline. The YouTube video thumbnail is rather good, too.
