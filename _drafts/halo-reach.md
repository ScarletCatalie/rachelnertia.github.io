Your friends die. You die. The planet dies. You don't exactly 'win the game' at the end of *Halo: Reach*'s single-player campaign.

Watching the latest *Star Wars* film, *Rogue One*, I was struck by the similarity of its finale to that of *Reach*[^1]. In *Rogue One* (spoilers, by the way), the heroes' self-sacrifice allows Princess Leia to escape with the plans for the Death Star -- the film ends almost immediately before *A New Hope* begins. In *Reach*, the heroes' self-sacrifice allows the Pillar of Autumn to escape, with Cortana and the Master Chief aboard, and therefore find the first Halo ring. The last lines of *Reach*'s script are the first of *Halo: Combat Evolved*:

> **Captain Keyes**: Cortana, all I need to know is *did we lose them*?
>
> **Cortana**: I think we both know the answer to that.

Stories which deploy this conceit have to be prequels -- at least, I can't think of any examples which aren't prequels -- because the only way you can get away with such a bleak ending is if the audience knows how it all works out okay in the end.

Which it does, of course, in three games' time. Your character's role is to set up the events of the first game, although you'd be very confused about the whole affair if you chose *Reach* as your entry point to the story -- it's more of a whistle-stop farewell tour for Bungie than an open door to new fans. It's not so surprising that the studio's last outing with the franchise was not aiming to be bigger, better, and 'more badass' than the last. Instead, they just wanted to come up with a fitting way to say goodbye.

In my opinion *Reach* might just be the best Halo game, if such a thing is worth arguing about, but I'll concede that it definitely isn't the most significant. Historically speaking, it didn't redefine and reinvigorate the console FPS the way the original *Halo* did. Personally speaking, I didn't spend hundreds of hours playing it with friends (and other miscreant Xbox Live denizens) like I did with *Halo 3*, and it wasn't the introduction to first-person shooters and the world of military action sci-fi that *Combat Evolved* was to me as a wee person[^2].

I'll also concede some other points. For one, there's really no way you could play this without having played the other games. It's too much of a prequel, too much of a love letter from Bungie to the series and its fans as they said farewell. *Halo 3: ODST* deserves a share of the spotlight, too. It brought back a few old things, tried out a few new things, and managed to create one of the most atmospheric post-alien-invasion cities I've ever seen in a game - although *Reach* pushes the envelope pretty hard there, too.

It fumbles in a few areas of its design. The newly-added [armour abilities](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Armor_Ability) feel like an undercooked replacement for *Halo 3*'s [equipment items](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Equipment). In that game, you would pick up an item like Bubble Shield and it would go into your single-item equipment slot. After one use it would be expended and you'd have to find another one. Equipment added a valuable extra tactical layer to the game.

*Reach*'s armour abilities are similar: you can only have one at a time, but you can use it over and over again until you swap it for something else. Some of them are direct analogues to equipment items from *Halo 3*. For example, there's one that deploys a bubble shield, and one that briefly turns you invisible. Unfortunately, you'll hardly ever use those ones, because one of the other abilities is *sprint*. Yes, the ability to run fast. The problem with having sprint as one of the armour abilities is that it is always useful, always applicable. It is hard to give up something like that just so you can occasionally spawn a decoy version of yourself. One of the abilities is a jetpack, which feels like a fair trade for sprint, but it's the exception -- the rest are useful once, but rarely twice.

In some ways, the weapon selection tells the same story. The classics make a return, more or less. The Assault Rifle is much the same as ever, albeit with more polys. The Pistol is pleasantly similar to *Combat Evolved*'s and *ODST*'s, but it is upstaged by the new Battle Rifle substitute: the DMR. It's a very accurate, punchy, general-purpose carbine-type gun that is useful in basically every situation. And if you're anything like me, you will end up using it in basically ever situation. It is this game's 'headshot gun'. So you have *that*, and then you have a grab-bag of new weapons, most of which are hard to use effectively. It's disappointing.

On the other hand, this is the game where Bungie really figured out how to make their weapons feel *punchy*. The DMR is the perfect example of this: when you pull the trigger it kicks back back at you, the crosshair in the middle of the HUD expands, and the sound of the shot rings out loud and powerful. The main ingredient is the sound design, which is as fantastic in this one detail as it is across the board.

Speaking of audio, the soundtrack is yet another brilliant outing by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori. Like in *ODST* they get to depart from the musical identity of the first three games, and they do it well, giving *Reach* a unique feel that references the older games' soundtracks but is not slavishly imitative of them. Check it out:

It's not quite as good as *ODST*'s soundtrack, but what is?

There's good variety in the levels in the campaign and, on the whole, the level design is the strongest in the series. You move from one well-thought-out combat arena to the next, from vehicular section to long-distance engagement to close-quarters firefight to showdown with some particularly challenging combination of enemies. There's a brief space section which leads into a fun mid-game crescendo of action. It's actually a pretty good level, and doesn't outstay its welcome.

The main thing about *Halo* level design is that it is all about supporting the game's AI, which in *Reach* is the most varied and interesting it's ever been. The full array of old Covenant baddies make a return. Sections which see you fighting Brutes (big burly ape-men) lead into battles against Elites (big burly... lizard[^3]..? men?) -- who are faster and scarier to fight than they were in the first two games. Skirmishers, a new enemy type, take the place of sniper-Jackals, are more versatile and highly mobile. They are able to jump onto the roofs of buildings and cover ground really quickly, attacking from unexpected directions.   

There's also no Flood, thank god.

- Xbox 360 struggling under the graphical weight.
- Enemy AI and design is varied and good, level design mostly supports it very well

[^1]: Which I replayed last year, by the way. Yeah, this post has been sitting in my drafts for a while.

[^2]: The family laptop me and my brother had to run our copy of *Halo 1* on had very limited graphics functionality. It was only years later, when we installed it on a better system, that we discovered the Master Chief's armour was in fact painted green, not white, and that there were weathered metallic (normal-mapped!) textures on things we thought were completely smooth. On that old computer I remember thinking how cool it was that the game went into slow motion when lots of things were happening all at once, which, in hindsight, was actually just the framerate dropping into single figures.

[^3]: One of *Halo*'s strengths (which is visible in Bungie's other work, *Destiny* and *Marathon*), is that with the exception of the Brutes the alien design is actually *alien*.
