Your teammates die. The planet dies. You die. You don't exactly 'win the game' at the end of *Halo: Reach*'s campaign. The only way you can get away with an ending this bleak is if the audience knows it all works out okay in the end.

Which it does, of course, this game being a prequel to the main *Halo* trilogy. The character you play's role in the story sets up the events of the first game, although you'd be very confused about the whole affair if you chose *Reach* as your entry point to the story and the franchise -- it's more of a whistle-stop farewell tour for Bungie than an open door to new fans. It's weird, but not so surprising, that the triple-A first-person shooter developer's last outing with the franchise was not aiming, as is so often the case with franchise instalments, to be bigger, better, and 'more badass' than the last. Instead, they just wanted to come up with a fitting way to say goodbye.

*Reach* might be the best Halo game, though it definitely isn't the most significant. It isn't even the one with the most significance to me. I didn't spend hundreds of hours playing it with my friends like I did with *Halo 3*, and it wasn't my first real introduction to first-person shooters and the world of military action sci-fi that *Combat Evolved* opened up to me as a wee person[^1].

I have a little trepidation about saying it's the best one, though. For one thing, there's really no way you could play this without having played the other games. It's too much of a prequel, too much of a love letter from Bungie to the series and its fans as they said farewell. And there's *ODST* to think about, the second-to-last in the series, which brings back a few old things, tries out a few new things, and manages to create one of the most atmospheric post-alien-invasion cities I've ever seen in a game - although *Reach* pushes the envelope on that front pretty hard, too.

*Reach* fumbles in a few areas. The newly-added armour abilities feel undercooked. They replace Halo 3's 'equipment' items. In that game, you would pick up items like the bubble shield and it would go into your single-item equipment slot. Then, after a single use, that item would be expended and you'd have to find another one.   Some of Reach's armour abilities are direct analogues for equipment items from Halo 3, such as the one that basically just deploys a bubble shield.
- Weapons. Some are just pointless.
- Xbox 360 struggling under the graphical weight.

But what about the things that make it a great game?

[^1]: The family laptop me and my brother had to run our copy of Halo 1 on had very limited graphics functionality and it was only years later when we installed it on a better system that we discovered the Master Chief's armour was in fact painted green, not white, and that there were weathered metallic textures on things we thought were completely smooth. On that old computer I remember thinking how cool it was that the game went into slow motion when lots of things were happening all at once, which, in hindsight, was actually just the framerate dropping to a standstill.
