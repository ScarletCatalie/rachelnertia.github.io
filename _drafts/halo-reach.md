Your friends die. The planet dies. You die. You don't exactly 'win the game' at the end of *Halo: Reach*'s campaign. Watching the latest *Star Wars* film, *Rogue One*, I was struck by the similarity of that film's finale to *Reach*'s, and began wondering about how widespread of a story trope the last-ditch suicide mission setting the stage for already-known outcomes is in fiction. I can't think of any examples which aren't prequels, and I can't imagine how it would work otherwise -- the only way you can get away with a such a bleak ending is if the audience knows it all works out okay in the end.

Which it does, of course, in three games' time. The character you play's role is to set up the events of the first game, although you'd be very confused about the whole affair if you chose *Reach* as your entry point to the story -- it's more of a whistle-stop farewell tour for Bungie than an open door to new fans. It's not so surprising that the triple-A first-person shooter developer's last outing with the franchise was not aiming to be bigger, better, and 'more badass' than the last. Instead, they just wanted to come up with a fitting way to say goodbye.

*Reach* might just be the best Halo game, but it definitely isn't the most significant. Historically, it didn't redefine and reinvigorate the console FPS the way the original *Halo* did. Personally, I didn't spend hundreds of hours playing it with my friends like I did with *Halo 3*, and it wasn't the introduction to first-person shooters and the world of military action sci-fi that *Combat Evolved* was to me as a wee person[^1].

I have a little trepidation about saying it's the best one, though. For one thing, there's really no way you could play this without having played the other games. It's too much of a prequel, too much of a love letter from Bungie to the series and its fans as they said farewell. And there's *ODST* to think about, the second-to-last in the series, which brings back a few old things, tries out a few new things, and manages to create one of the most atmospheric post-alien-invasion cities I've ever seen in a game - although *Reach* pushes the envelope on that front pretty hard, too.

It also fumbles in a few areas. The newly-added armour abilities feel undercooked. They replace Halo 3's 'equipment' items. In that game, you would pick up items like the bubble shield and it would go into your single-item equipment slot. Then, after a single use, that item would be expended and you'd have to find another one. Some of Reach's armour abilities are direct analogues for equipment items from Halo 3, such as the one that basically just deploys a bubble shield. The problem is that one of the armour abilities is *sprint*, and once you've been using it for any length of time, it becomes very difficult to sacrifice it just so that you can occasionally deploy a decoy of yourself. In *Halo* games, you move slowly. In almost all other contemporary first-person shooter franchises, sprinting had been an out-of-the-box ability since *Call of Duty 4*. Granted, one of the armour abilities is a jetpack, and trading one movement mechanic for another feels like a fair trade, particularly when it grants vertical freedom, but otherwise it doesn't feel worth it to give up a power that ought to be standard. When I play the other *Halo* games, I don't feel bad that I can't sprint because the option was never given to me and I never assumed it would.

The arsenal of weapons available is a similar story. The classics all make a return, more or less,... The Battle Rifle is substituted with the DMR **(is this what it's actually called?)**, a very accurate, punchy, general-purpose carbine-type gun that is useful in basically every situation.  

- Weapons. Some are just pointless.
- Xbox 360 struggling under the graphical weight.

But what about the things that make it a great game?

[^1]: The family laptop me and my brother had to run our copy of Halo 1 on had very limited graphics functionality and it was only years later when we installed it on a better system that we discovered the Master Chief's armour was in fact painted green, not white, and that there were weathered metallic textures on things we thought were completely smooth. On that old computer I remember thinking how cool it was that the game went into slow motion when lots of things were happening all at once, which, in hindsight, was actually just the framerate dropping to a standstill.
