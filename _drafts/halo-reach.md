You die at the end. Your teammates die. The planet dies. You die.

The only way you can get away with an ending this bleak is if the audience knows how it all works out okay in the end.

I think *Reach* might be the best Halo game, although it definitely isn't the one with the most significance to me. I didn't spend hundreds of hours in matchmaking or in custom games with friends in *Reach* like I did in *Halo 3*, and it wasn't my first real introduction to first-person shooters and the world of military action sci-fi that *Combat Evolved* opened up to me as a wee person[^1].

I have a little trepidation about saying it's the best one, though. For one thing, there's really no way you could play this without having played the other games. It's too much of a prequel, too much of a love letter from Bungie to the series and its fans as they said farewell. And there's *ODST* to think about, the second-to-last in the series, which brings back a few old things, tries out a few new things, and manages to create one of the most atmospheric post-alien-invasion cities I've ever seen in a game - although *Reach* pushes the envelope on that front pretty hard, too.

*Reach* fumbles in a few areas.
- Armour abilities
- Weapons. Some are just pointless.
- Xbox 360 struggling under the graphical weight.

But what about the things that make it a great game?

[^1]: The family laptop me and my brother had to run our copy of Halo 1 on had very limited graphics functionality and it was only years later when we installed it on a better system that we discovered the Master Chief's armour was in fact painted green, not white, and that there were weathered metallic textures on things we thought were completely smooth. On that old computer I remember thinking how cool it was that the game went into slow motion when lots of things were happening all at once, which, in hindsight, was actually just the framerate dropping to a standstill.
