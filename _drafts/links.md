**Sandi Metz - [Nothing is Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29MAL8pJImQ)** (keynote speech at RailsConf 2015) Should be interesting and educational for all the programmers out there. Sandi talks about how to tackle object oriented programming problems, and the [Null Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern) pattern, the idea of the *Active Nothing*. It's Ruby-focused, but practical Object-Oriented Design lessons are applicable across most languages.

[Her speech from the previous year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOM5_V5jLAs) is more about life than programming, but it is very, very worth a watch.

[**Woodland Secrets Ep. 54: Katherine Cross**](http://woodlandsecrets.co/episode/54) -- This was a great episode, with Merritt Kopas and her guest holding a long, in-depth conversation on the subjects of sociology, work, gamification, and online discourse. Katherine Cross' writing on society, culture and games is well worth exploring.

Universal basic income talk.
