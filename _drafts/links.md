**Sandi Metz - [Nothing is Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29MAL8pJImQ)** (keynote speech at RailsConf 2015) Should be interesting and educational for all the programmers out there. Sandi talks about how to tackle object oriented programming problems, and the [Null Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern) pattern, the idea of the *Active Nothing*. It's Ruby-focused, but practical Object-Oriented Design lessons are applicable across most languages.

[Her speech from the previous year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOM5_V5jLAs) is more about life than programming, but it is very, very worth a watch.

[**Woodland Secrets Ep. 54: Katherine Cross**](http://woodlandsecrets.co/episode/54) -- This was a great episode, with Merritt Kopas and her guest holding a long, in-depth conversation on the subjects of sociology, work, gamification, and online discourse. Katherine Cross' writing on society, culture and games is well worth exploring.

Universal basic income talk.

You may have heard of 99% Invisible, the excellent podcast that covers all things design. This episode, [Turf Wars of East New York](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/turf-wars/), contains some excellent historical insight into the widespread issue facing American cities (and other cities around the world) of gentrification, 20th-century shifts in inner city residential demographics, and how inextricably knotted up it all is with US racist and ethnic tension. Racial segregation was encouraged by the capitalist system and the flames of racial tension were stoked by those interested in making as much money as they could from property.

>Brooklyn was in the process of absorbing two big migrations: southern blacks were coming north in search of industrial jobs, and Puerto Ricans were fleeing the decimated economy of their island. Segregation, however, limited migrant housing options, so neighborhoods like Bedfordâ€“Stuyvesant and Harlem quickly became overcrowded and newcomers began to look elsewhere in the city.

>Landlords and real estate investors saw opportunity in the desperation of immigrant populations. They would come to hone two profit-driven tactics that would subsequently shape neighborhoods around the country: fear-induced white flight and predatory lending.

>In the Cold War era of atomic concerns following World War II, the government pursued a policy of dispersing what were considered essential populations and critical manufacturing capabilities. Federal authorities began subsidizing mortgages and highways in what became a successful effort to relocate a certain class of (generally: white and educated) homeowner to soon-booming American suburbs.

>...Real estate investors took advantage of fear, using scare tactics and going door-to-door pressuring [white] people to sell properties (also known as: [blockbusting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbusting)).
