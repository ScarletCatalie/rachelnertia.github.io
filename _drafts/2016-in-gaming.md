This post is about what I played in 2016 which, as I see it, was a pretty amazing year for games.

On the tabletop front I enjoyed some fantastic games. The main one that I can think of is, oddly enough, [*Condottiere*](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/condottiere/). I've owned *Condottiere* for years but until spending some long evenings playing it with a group of friends this year, never really appreciated it for what it is -- a tightly-designed blend of strategy, hidden information and bluffing, with nice theming and artwork to boot. It is also very obviously the main inspiration for [*Gwent*](https://www.playgwent.com/en). I'm resistant to *Gwent* for its [*Magic: The Gathering*](http://magic.wizards.com/en)-like collectible card game trappings, but they do give the game something *Condottiere* doesn't have: in *Condottiere* the occasional round will be won by sheer luck before it even begins, something that wouldn't happen in a game with pre-built, rather than randomly-generated, hands of cards. There's also a snowball effect that occurs once one or more players start pulling ahead of the pack. Despite these criticisms, *Condottiere* is one of those games that's physically small enough and cheap enough that I think every board gamer ought to have a copy.

This year also introduced me to [*Codenames*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames). I must have played it more than fifty times so far, and it's yet to disappoint as a party game.

Meanwhile in videogame land [*The Witcher III*](http://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/) continued to amaze, with the *Hearts of Stone* expansion demonstrating more storytelling finesse alone than most full writing-heavy games ever achieve even for a moment. I played it in January, so yes, I *can* include it here. *Hearts of Stone* is probably my favourite variation on the classic Faustian tale and I strongly recommend. I've yet to play *Blood and Wine*, unfortunately, but I'm really looking forward to it.

[*Devil Daggers*](http://devildaggers.com/) is another of my games of the year. I've yet to get more than 150 seconds or so in, but those were some *long*, intense seconds, just like every second of every attempt I made leading up to that high score. Playing it in front of a crowd at [Games Are For Everyone]({% post_url 2016-10-27-adventures-in-the-real-world %}), in a cavernous old wine cellar beneath South Bridge in Edinburgh, with thick red candles strewn about, isn't something I'll forget in a hurry.

[*Lieve Oma*](https://vltmn.itch.io/lieve-oma) was also featured at Games Are For Everyone and is a strong contender for my sweetest, most loveable game of the year. Here is a game simply about going for a walk with your grandmother in the woods, and it made me feel *stuff* and *things*. Good stuff and things! I won't say anymore. I hope you check it out.

This year I've not had much time to spend on big long games, which has meant that shorter-form games like *Devil Daggers* and *Lieve Oma* have had a chance to shine while mainstream triple-A releases have fallen to the wayside. I'm currently halfway through a replay of [*Dishonored*](http://store.steampowered.com/app/205100/) (including its excellent DLC), which I want to complete before I get the sequel. As I write this I'm sitting watching Natalie play the new [*Doom*](http://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/). A lot of demons are exploding. It seems to really capture some of the design spirit of the original *Doom* games while confidently doing its own thing. A bit like *Devil Daggers*, I suppose.

Also, [*Oblivion* turned 10 this year]({%post_url 2016-03-22-oblivion %}). Wild.

There's much more to write about here, other games I've played and enjoyed, but there's things to be getting on with. If 2017 has half as rich a crop of good games I want to play I'll never be able to catch up. And that's okay.
