- Let me set the thresholds at which you remind me that my hazard protection and life support systems are running out of power.

- I like that you can walk up basically any slope as long as it isn't vertical, but you move slower on the climb. You move a little faster on the way down. You land with a satisfying (painful if you underestimate the distance) thud. This sounds like such a small thing but so many games in which one of the main activities is just walking to and fro (like Skyrim, Fallout 4, The Witcher III...) *don't* put stuff like this in, even though they might have a sophisticated third-person animation system that makes sure your character's feet are placed accurately on the ground and legs bend realistically as they ascend or descend. This game is a walking simulator, as in, it goes to lengths to literally simulate the way it feels to walk, as best as can be done with the format, anyway. This game has exceptionally good head bob.

- Everything *sounds* so fricking good. I keep having momentary flashes where I wonder if I've fallen somehow into *Proteus* as the soundscape lines up for just a fraction of a second with an approximation of that game's.

- I wish upgrade descriptions were more clear.

- Give me control over how and how much various HUD elements are displayed. And let me turn down or off the various post-processing effects. They're nice, but a little aggressive. And put in a HUD toggle button! There are at least 3 unused buttons on the gamepad, so why not?
