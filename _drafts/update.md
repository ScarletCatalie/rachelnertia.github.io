title: Update
---

I haven't posted anything here for a while, and that's a damn shame. I've mostly been spending my spare 'creative time' doing programming for my game/engine, and haven't really felt the energy or drive to commit to writing blog posts. 

That's enough moping. I am writing this while sitting in a dark corner of a restaurant populated seemingly almost entirely by young men who look like they must be under 20 years old (I don't know why). I am staying in the hotel this restaurant is part of tonight because I have to get an early flight from Glasgow Airport tomorrow morning. The flight from Glasgow will take me to Heathrow, and from there I will fly to San Francisco to attend Game Developer's Conference (GDC), a fact which feels completely unreal to me.

I'll see you on the other side.
