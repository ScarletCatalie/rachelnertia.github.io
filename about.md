Hiya. I'm Rachel. I'm a game developer who specialises in programming. I am currently in my fourth and final year of study at [Abertay University](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/) in Dundee, learning [Computer Games Technology](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/courses//ug/comopgamestech/). 

You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nershly) and [Tumblr](http://nershly.tumblr.com/), although I don't recommend it.

This site is the product of the marriage of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can find the repository at <https://github.com/rachelnertia/rachelnertia.github.io>.
