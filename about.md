Hiya. I'm Rachel. I'm a budding game developer specialising in programming. I am currently in my fourth and final year of study at [Abertay University](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/) in bonny Dundee, Scotland, taking BSc (Hons) [Computer Games Technology](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/courses//ug/comopgamestech/). 

Are you thinking about hiring me for some reason? I have a [CV page](/cv) just for you!

You can follow me elsewhere on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nershly) and [Tumblr](http://nershly.tumblr.com/), although I don't recommend it. I also have an [itch.io page](http://inertia.itch.io/). 

This site is representative of my ongoing struggle to learn web programming, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can check out the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rachelnertia/rachelnertia.github.io) if you wish.
